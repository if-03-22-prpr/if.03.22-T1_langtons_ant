Introduction</h1>
<p>The console version of 'Langton's Ant'.</p>
<p>Langton's ant (beware: his ant, not his aunt!) lives in it's special universe.</p>
<p>That universe is flat but endless - like the surface of a Doughnut - and consits of a number of discrete regions - the cells. Each cell shows one color from a range of colors. The color range is rather limited: it consists of WHITE and BLACK (probably due to the limited vision of the ant).</p>
<p>The ant is capable of recognizing the color of the cell it currently resides on and decides - based on that color - whether it turns left or right before moving on. When the ant leaves a cell, it changes the color of that cell. It is not known, if the ant is aware or surprised of the different color when it visits the cell again, most probably it does not even remember that it was already there.</p>
<p><b>Background Info - Fun Facts</b></p>
<p>Christopher Langton invited this two-dimensional universal Turing machine in 1986 as an example for a self-contained, complete, deterministic system with simple rules and initial state, which can get both,surprisingly 'chaotic' as well as surprisingly regular states. The state of the universe (expressed as colors of its cells) for a given number of steps cannot be calculated using a formula. Each step has to be performed to determine the state of the universe after a number of steps.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="objective"></a>
Assignment Objective</h1>
<p>In this assignment the required Abstract Data Types and the (rather simple) render loop shall be implemented. A visualizer (renderer) is provided and shall be used. All unit tests provided for this assignment shall become 'green' and the application shall render the walk of the ant frame by frame.</p>
<p><b>Configuration</b></p>
<p>Because we operate on static memory, the maximum size of the ant's world in each dimension along with the number of steps to take can be configured in <code>config.h</code>.</p>
<p><b>Setup and Execution</b></p>
<p>The world - there is exactly one world - is initialized with its dimensions, which may be at maximum as large as the related <code>MAX_WORLD_SIZE</code> configuration. Initially all cells have a <code>WHITE</code> color.</p>
<p>The ant is initialized with it's starting position on the world and the initial viewing position.</p>
<p>To run the application, the function <code>run_langtons_ant(...)</code> need to be implemented in <code>la_main_driver.c</code> as follows:</p><ol type="1">
<li>initializes the ant's world</li>
<li>initializes the ant</li>
<li>renders the first frame via la_render_frame(...) function</li>
<li>makes the ant performing a step</li>
<li>renders the next frame in the same way as described above</li>
<li>continues at bullet 4) for the number of steps.</li>
</ol>
<p>As usually the tests can be compiled and performed via <code>make test</code> or <code>make cleartest</code>. The application can be compiled and run via <code>make</code> or <code>make clear</code>.</p>
<p><b>Rules</b></p>
<p>The ant steps on the surface of it's world in and endless manner.</p>
<p>This 'world' is represented by a two-dimensional array of colored cells. The endlessness of the surface is realized as follows:</p><ul>
<li>When the ant steps over the right border, it appears in the left-most cell of the same row.</li>
<li>When the ant steps over the left border, it appears in the right-most cell of the same row.</li>
<li>When the ant steps over the bottom border, it appears in the top-most cell of the same column.</li>
<li>When the ant steps over the top border, it appears in the bottom-most cell of the same column.</li>
</ul>
<p>For each step, the ant performs the following actions in the given order:</p><ol type="1">
<li>it determinats the color of the cell it currently sits on</li>
<li>it changes its direction depending on the cell-color<ol type="a">
<li>if the color is <code>WHITE</code>: the ant turns 90° clockwise (e.g from <code>NORTH</code> to <code>EAST</code> or from <code>SOUTH</code> to <code>WEST</code>)</li>
<li>if the color is <code>BLACK</code>: the ant turns 90° counter-clockwise (e.g from <code>SOUTH</code> to <code>EAST</code> or from <code>NORTH</code> to <code>WEST</code>)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>it flips the color of the cell (from <code>WHITE</code> to <code>BLACK</code> and vice versa)</li>
<li>it jumps to the next cell according to the current direction. The position of the next cell is determined by <code>get_next_x_pos(...)</code> and <code>get_next_y_pos(...)</code> of <code>la_world.h</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Visualization</b></p>
<p>The world including the ant on it is rendered using function <code>la_render_frame(...)</code> provided by <code>la_visualizer.h</code>. The world need to be rendered initially and after each step. The step number is printed as well.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="assignment"></a>
Assignment</h1>
<p>To complete this assignment in a short time, it is vital, to develop the code in a focused and clean way, step by step.</p>
<p>Many unit tests are provided to ease development. If too many failed unit tests appear - especially at the beginning of development- they can be commented in file <code>la_test_driver.c</code> for files that are currently not in focus. However, they need to be reactivated as development proceeds.</p>
<p><b>Hint:</b> Read and obey the API docs of the types and functions as well as the comments within the code.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Complete<ul>
<li>include guards</li>
<li>forward declarations,</li>
<li>types,</li>
<li>and function for ADTs in <code>general.h</code>, <code>la_ant.h</code>, <code>la_world.c</code>, and <code>la_main_driver.c</code>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Types in template files may be marked as <code>&lt;type&gt;</code> within header and source files or may be omitted completely. Replace <code>&lt;type&gt;</code> with the correct type and complete missing types. Some types, those which are shared among multiple sources, are located in <code>general.h</code>.</li>
<li>Parameter lists of function in template files may be missing or incomplete.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make the program and tests compile: Implement all functions in all relevant files declared in the headers EMTPY (return nothing, 0, false, ... as required).<ul>
<li>All unit tests shall run but FAIL after this step</li>
<li><b>&ndash;COMMIT&ndash;</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implement the empty functions one by one to make the unit tests pass one by one.<ul>
<li>Proposed order: la_ant, la_world, la_main_driver.</li>
<li>The purpose of a function is specified as API documentation within the header files.</li>
<li>Obey comments in source files. Run the unit tests frequently and fix failures.</li>
<li><b>&ndash;COMMIT&ndash; after each implemented function.</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implement the main render loop and other missing parts in <code>la_main_driver.c</code> function.<ul>
<li><b>&ndash;COMMIT&ndash;</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Let the ant begin its journey.</li>
</ol>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="notes"></a>
Notes</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li>Visualization is implemented for Linux shell, it will not work on Windows.</li>
<li>Sometimes changes are not properly detected by incremental builds. If something very strange happens during compilation, try to run <code>make clean</code> followed by <code>make</code> to start a clean build. This approach is also recommended after everthing is done, because some compiler warning appears only in clean builds. </li>
